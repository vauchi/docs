# TDD Rules

## Three Laws

1. **No production code without a failing test**
2. **Write only enough test to fail**
3. **Write only enough code to pass**

## Red-Green-Refactor-Commit

```
RED     → Write failing test
GREEN   → Minimal code to pass  → COMMIT (tests green)
REFACTOR → Improve design       → COMMIT (tests still green)
```

**Commit early, commit often:**

- Commit immediately after GREEN (tests pass for the first time)
- Commit after each REFACTOR cycle (if tests still pass)
- Small, atomic commits make rollback and review easier
- Never commit with failing tests

## Test Types

| Type | Scope | Speed | Coverage |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| Unit | Single function | < 100ms | 90% min |
| Integration | Multiple components | < 5s | Critical paths |
| E2E | Full system | < 60s | All Gherkin scenarios |

## Naming

```
test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected>

Examples:
- test_encrypt_valid_key_returns_ciphertext
- test_decrypt_wrong_key_fails
```

## Critical Rules

**Crypto** - Never mock. Test with real crypto:

- Roundtrip (encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify)
- Wrong key rejection
- Tampered data rejection

**Gherkin** - Every scenario in `features/` must have a test.

**Coverage** - 90% minimum for vauchi-core.

## Forbidden

- Writing code before tests
- Mocking crypto operations
- `#[ignore]` without tracking issue
- Flaky/non-deterministic tests
- Hardcoded test secrets

## Mocking Strategy

| Component | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Crypto | Real (never mock) |
| Network | Mock transport |
| Storage | In-memory DB |
| Time | Mockable clock |
