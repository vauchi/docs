## ADR-001: Rust for Core Library

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-01

**Context**: Need a language for the shared core library that compiles to mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, and WebAssembly.

**Decision**: Rust

**Rationale**:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Compiles to native (mobile via UniFFI, desktop) and WASM
- Strong ecosystem for cryptography (`ring` crate)
- Predictable performance for crypto operations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- C/C++: Memory safety concerns, harder FFI
- Go: GC pauses, larger binary size, poor WASM support
- Kotlin Multiplatform: iOS support immature at time of decision

---

## ADR-002: ring Crate for Cryptography

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-01

**Context**: Need production-ready cryptographic primitives.

**Decision**: Use `ring` crate exclusively for all crypto.

**Rationale**:
- Audited, production-ready (used by rustls, Cloudflare)
- No custom crypto implementations
- Supports Ed25519, X25519, AES-GCM, PBKDF2, HKDF
- Constant-time operations where needed

**Consequences**:
- Cannot use XChaCha20-Poly1305 directly (ring doesn't have it)
- Using AES-256-GCM instead for symmetric encryption
- Tests must use real crypto, no mocking

---

## ADR-003: SQLite for Local Storage

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-01

**Context**: Need local persistence that works on all platforms.

**Decision**: SQLite with application-level encryption.

**Rationale**:
- Available on all platforms (mobile, desktop, WASM via sql.js)
- Single-file database, easy backup
- Application-level encryption allows fine-grained control
- Proven reliability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- SQLCipher: Adds native dependency complexity
- LevelDB/RocksDB: No SQL, harder queries
- Custom file format: Reinventing the wheel

---

## ADR-004: WebSocket Relay for MVP Sync

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-03

**Context**: Need to sync updates between contacts when both online or one offline.

**Decision**: WebSocket relay server for MVP; libp2p DHT planned for future.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler NAT traversal than P2P
- Faster to implement and deploy
- Store-and-forward handles offline contacts
- Can migrate to DHT later without protocol changes

**Consequences**:
- Relay is a potential single point of failure (mitigated by federation plan)
- Relay sees encrypted blobs but no plaintext
- Users can self-host relay

**Future**: Migrate to libp2p with DHT discovery for fully decentralized sync.

---

## ADR-005: JSON for Internal Serialization

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-06

**Context**: Need serialization format for storage and sync payloads.

**Decision**: JSON (via serde_json)

**Rationale**:
- Human-readable for debugging
- No schema compilation step
- Sufficient performance for our data sizes (<64KB cards)
- Universal support across platforms

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Protocol Buffers: Schema compilation, overkill for simple structures
- MessagePack: Binary, harder to debug, marginal size benefit
- CBOR: Less ecosystem support

**Note**: Wire protocol uses encrypted binary blobs; JSON is internal only.

---

## ADR-006: X3DH + Double Ratchet for Key Exchange

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-02

**Context**: Need secure key exchange with forward secrecy for contact communication.

**Decision**: X3DH for initial exchange, Double Ratchet for ongoing messages.

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard (Signal Protocol)
- Forward secrecy: Past messages safe if keys compromised
- Future secrecy: Compromised keys heal after ratchet step
- Well-understood security properties

**Implementation**:
- X3DH: `vauchi-core/src/exchange/x3dh.rs`
- Double Ratchet: `vauchi-core/src/crypto/ratchet.rs`

---

## ADR-007: HKDF for Device Key Derivation

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Multi-device sync requires per-device keys derived from master seed.

**Decision**: HKDF with domain separation for all key derivation.

**Rationale**:
- Deterministic: Same seed + index = same device keys
- Domain separation prevents key reuse across contexts
- Standard (RFC 5869), implemented in `ring`

**Derivation Paths**:
```
Master Seed
├── "Vauchi_Identity" → Ed25519 signing keypair
├── "Vauchi_Exchange_Seed" → X25519 exchange keypair
└── "Vauchi_Device_{index}" → Per-device keys
```

---

## ADR-008: Version Vectors for Sync Conflict Resolution

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Multi-device sync needs to detect and resolve conflicts.

**Decision**: Version vectors with last-write-wins resolution.

**Rationale**:
- Tracks causality across devices
- Detects concurrent modifications
- Simple LWW resolution appropriate for contact cards
- No need for complex CRDT merge logic

**Implementation**: `vauchi-core/src/sync/device_sync.rs:VersionVector`

---

## ADR-009: QR + Proximity for Contact Exchange

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-02

**Context**: Need secure in-person contact exchange.

**Decision**: QR code as primary method; BLE/NFC as future options.

**Rationale**:
- QR works on all devices with camera
- No special hardware required
- Proximity requirement prevents remote harvesting
- BLE/NFC can be added later for convenience

**Security**:
- QR contains X25519 public key + identity signature
- Proximity verified by exchange completion timing
- Audio verification planned for additional security

---

## ADR-010: UniFFI for Mobile Bindings

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2024-08

**Context**: Need to expose Rust core to iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin).

**Decision**: UniFFI for generating mobile bindings.

**Rationale**:
- Single interface definition, generates Swift + Kotlin
- Handles memory management across FFI boundary
- Maintained by Mozilla, production-ready
- Cleaner than manual JNI/C bindings

**Implementation**: `vauchi-mobile/` crate with UDL definitions.

---

## ADR-011: Event-Driven Architecture

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Mobile and desktop applications need to react to asynchronous events (contact updates, sync state changes, connection status) without polling.

**Decision**: Implement an event system with typed events, handler traits, and a central dispatcher.

**Rationale**:
- Decouples core logic from UI layers
- Enables multiple listeners (logging, UI updates, analytics)
- Type-safe event handling via `VauchiEvent` enum
- Thread-safe with `Send + Sync` requirements

**Implementation**:
- `VauchiEvent`: Enum of all possible events
- `EventHandler`: Trait for event consumers
- `EventDispatcher`: Broadcasts events to registered handlers
- Location: `vauchi-core/src/api/events.rs`

---

## ADR-012: Visibility Rule Enforcement

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Users need fine-grained control over which contacts can see which fields on their contact card.

**Decision**: Per-field visibility rules with three levels: Everyone, specific Contacts, or Nobody.

**Rationale**:
- Simple mental model for users
- Flexible enough for privacy needs
- Serializable for sync between devices
- Efficient filtering at query time

**Implementation**:
- `FieldVisibility`: Enum (Everyone | Contacts(HashSet) | Nobody)
- `VisibilityRules`: HashMap<field_id, FieldVisibility>
- `can_see(field, contact)`: Fast visibility check
- Location: `vauchi-core/src/contact/visibility.rs`

---

## ADR-013: Unified Error Types

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Multiple crates have their own error types. API layer needs consistent error handling for consumers.

**Decision**: Single `VauchiError` enum that wraps all domain-specific errors via `#[from]`.

**Rationale**:
- Single error type for public API
- Automatic conversion from internal errors via `thiserror`
- Preserves error context through the chain
- Consistent error messages for UI display

**Implementation**:
- `VauchiError`: Top-level enum with variants for each domain
- `VauchiResult<T>`: Type alias for `Result<T, VauchiError>`
- Variants: Validation, Exchange, Storage, Sync, Network, etc.
- Location: `vauchi-core/src/api/error.rs`

---

## ADR-014: Pending Update Queue

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Devices may be offline when changes occur. Updates must be queued and retried reliably.

**Decision**: SQLite-backed pending update queue with status tracking and retry support.

**Rationale**:
- Survives app restarts (persisted)
- Supports retry with exponential backoff
- Tracks per-update status (Pending, Sending, Failed)
- Ordered by creation time

**Implementation**:
- `PendingUpdate`: Struct with id, contact_id, payload, retry_count, status
- `UpdateStatus`: Enum (Pending | Sending | Failed)
- Storage methods: `queue_update`, `get_pending_updates`, `mark_update_sent`
- Location: `vauchi-core/src/storage/mod.rs`

---

## ADR-015: Application-Level Encryption

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: SQLite stores sensitive data (contact cards, shared keys, ratchet states). Need encryption at rest.

**Decision**: Application-level encryption for sensitive fields using AES-256-GCM.

**Rationale**:
- Works on all platforms without SQLCipher dependency
- Fine-grained control over what gets encrypted
- Encryption key derived from user's master key
- Non-sensitive metadata (IDs, timestamps) remain queryable

**Encrypted Fields**:
- `card_encrypted`: Contact cards (JSON)
- `shared_key_encrypted`: Per-contact symmetric keys
- `ratchet_state_encrypted`: Double Ratchet state
- `backup_data_encrypted`: Identity backup

**Implementation**: `vauchi-core/src/storage/mod.rs`

---

## ADR-016: Social Network Registry

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Contact cards include social media profiles. Need standardized network identifiers and profile URL generation.

**Decision**: Embedded JSON registry of 35+ social networks with URL templates.

**Rationale**:
- Compile-time embedding via `include_str!`
- No network requests needed for URL generation
- Handles username normalization (stripping @, etc.)
- Extensible via merge for custom networks

**Implementation**:
- `SocialNetwork`: Network definition with URL template
- `SocialNetworkRegistry`: HashMap with search, URL generation
- `networks.json`: Embedded data file
- Location: `vauchi-core/src/social/registry.rs`

---

## ADR-017: Sync Controller Orchestration

**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Synchronization involves multiple components: relay client, sync manager, ratchet states, events. Need central coordination.

**Decision**: `SyncController` as the orchestration layer integrating all sync concerns.

**Rationale**:
- Single entry point for sync operations
- Manages ratchet lifecycle per contact
- Coordinates relay connection and pending updates
- Emits events for UI feedback
- Handles timeout and retry logic

**Responsibilities**:
- Connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
- Ratchet registration per contact
- Sync cycle execution (send pending, process acks)
- Device sync integration

**Implementation**: `vauchi-core/src/api/sync_controller.rs`

---

## ADR-018: Contact Recovery via Social Vouching

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2026-01

**Context**: Users who lose all their devices lose their identity (master seed, keys) and cannot reconnect with contacts. Traditional recovery methods (phone number, cloud backup) have security weaknesses (SIM swap, account compromise). Users need a way to recover contact *relationships* without pre-designated recovery contacts that could also be lost.

**Decision**: Implement social vouching recovery where:
1. User creates new identity after device loss
2. User meets K contacts in person (coordinated via phone/WhatsApp/etc.)
3. Each contact creates a signed voucher linking old identity to new
4. Recovery proof (K vouchers) uploaded to relay
5. Other contacts discover via polling, verify via mutual contact trust
6. Isolated contacts (no mutual vouchers) get warnings and verification options

**Rationale**:
- **No pre-designation needed**: Any contact can vouch, nothing to remember/lose
- **In-person verification**: Human recognition as trust anchor (same as initial exchange)
- **Distributed trust**: Each contact decides based on their own network
- **Graceful degradation**: Isolated contacts aren't blocked, just warned
- **Minimal relay knowledge**: Relay only stores opaque blobs under hashed keys

**Key Design Elements**:
- `RecoveryClaim`: QR code with old_pk, new_pk, timestamp
- `RecoveryVoucher`: Signed attestation from contact (Ed25519)
- `RecoveryProof`: Aggregated vouchers meeting threshold
- Relay storage: `hash(old_pk) → RecoveryProof`
- Verification: Count vouchers from contacts the verifier also knows

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|--------------|
| Pre-designated recovery contacts | Lost with device, adds setup friction |
| Password-protected backup | Single point of failure, users forget passwords |
| Seed phrase | Users lose/expose phrases, not user-friendly |
| Phone number recovery | Vulnerable to SIM swap attacks |
| Cloud backup | Vulnerable to account compromise |
| Threshold secret sharing | Requires pre-setup, complex key management |

**Security Trade-offs**:

| Benefit | Cost |
|---------|------|
| No setup required | Any contact can vouch (larger surface) |
| Human verification | Requires physical meetings |
| Distributed trust | Isolated contacts get warnings only |
| Works after total loss | Voucher list reveals partial graph |

**Threat Mitigations**:
- Recovery impersonation → Requires fooling K people in person
- Graph leakage → Only public keys revealed, accepted tradeoff
- Conflicting claims → Relay detects, users warned
- Isolated contacts → Clear warnings, multiple verification options

**Implementation**:
- Feature spec: `features/future/contact_recovery.feature`
- Planning doc: `docs/planning/todo/contact-recovery.md`
- Threat analysis: `docs/THREAT_ANALYSIS.md` (Section 9)
